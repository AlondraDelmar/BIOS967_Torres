IP data
Objective: To isolate and identify specific proteins or protein complexes from a complex mixture of proteins.
	IP identifies the presence of the target proteins in the eluate.
	The eluted proteins can be visualized on a gel to confirmed with specific antibodies (PET117).
	Co-immunoprecipitated proteins will indicate interactions with the target proteins.
Interpretation:
Results indicate whether the target proteins interact with other proteins.
Species: HEK293 cells
